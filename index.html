                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>22 year old Julia Siraj is a rising voice in the soul-pop sphere writing unguarded lyrics to warm chords, energetic drums and ample arrangements. Influenced by the likes of Erykah Badu and Cleo Sol she expresses herself boldly and with intention in her debut single “Charlotte”. Marking the start of the journey towards her EP “Growing Pains” Siraj takes the listener on a sweet ride through deep valleys of confessional lyricism and offers the listener care with her vibrato colored voice.</p>
                <p>The daughter of an Eritrean father and a Swedish mother, Siraj was raised in a small town in central Sweden happy to be consumed by the music she was raised with. Nina Simone, Jill Scott, Pink Floyd, Outkast, Ben Howard and Stevie Wonder were all voices on heavy rotation growing up. Deeply inspired by 90’s hip hop and the graphic poetry of her favorite folk artists, Siraj is at the brink of untouched territory as she anchors herself in a contemporary soul-world of her own.</p>
